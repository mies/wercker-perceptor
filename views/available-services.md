# Available Services

Most applications use a database to store data or a message queue to handle jobs asynchronously. With wercker you can specify which services you require and wercker will provision them for you.

This is done by specifying the required services in your `wercker.json` file. Through environment variables you will then be able to access these services.

wercker.json

To be able to use services you must first specify them in the service property in the `wercker.json` file. You simply specify the name as the key and use 'true' as the value:

``` json
  {
    "services": {
      "mysql": true
    }
  }
```
